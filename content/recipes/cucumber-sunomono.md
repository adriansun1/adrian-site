### INGREDIENTS

- 1 cucumber
- 5g wakame
- 2tsp salt
- sesame seeds

SAUCE RATIO
- 1 rice vinegar
- 1 mirin
- 1 soy sauce

### DIRECTIONS 

1. combine sauce
1. wakame in water
1. Thinly slice cucumbers, add salt, toss
1. rest 10 mins
1. drain cucumbers and wakame
1. combine and add sauce
1. w/ sesame seeds

### NOTES:

lacking in acidity, too high salt content.Â if making again should lower salt by 1/3rd then raise amount of vinegar.

Not sure if i like the flavor profile of the soy sauce and mirin, weighs dish down when i feel it should be light.
